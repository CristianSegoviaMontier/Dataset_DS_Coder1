Data file name: eqcat_CEUS1568-2018.txt(.csv)

Purpose: A seismicity catalog generated for a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) study.

Summary: The earthquake catalog was generated in August 2018 by Chuck Mueller (cmueller@usgs.gov; Emeritus) using the standard NSHM methodology for the CEUS (Mueller, 2019). 
Pre-existing catalogs were merged, duplicate records were removed, the catalog was declustered, and induced earthquakes were removed. 
The final catalog contains 6802 records, M2.5 to 7.8, and extends from 1568 through July 2018. The catalog contains 14 columns defined below:

Mw	nonsepecific moment magnitude
long_degE [longitude degrees east]	longitude decimal degrees east WGS84
lat_degN [latitude degrees north]	latitude decimal degrees north WGS84
depth_km	depth in kilometers
year		year
month		month
day		day
hour		hour
minute		minute
second		second
mag_uncert[magnitude uncertainty]	magnitude uncertainty
Mwe		expected moment magnitude, often, but not always, equal to Mw
N_[N*]		counting factor for rate calculations
comment	comment
